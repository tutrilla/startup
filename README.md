**What is the application?**

This is a software that specializes in the management process of recruitling language specialists in the translation industry, ranging anywhere from translators, interpreters, voice talents, desktop publishers, etc.

## **Elevator Pitch**

Translation agencies are tasked to find the right linguists in order to ensure that the quality of the translation content is of an professional level. However, there are many things that go into the recruitment process of linguists in order to ensure that they are of professional grade. You may think that it is an easy process of just finding a person, giving them a test, and then adding them to your contact list, but there is many levels to consider, everything from seeing their translation quality, verifying that they are who they claim, and of course the paperwork. These recruitment teams often get overwhelmed with the amount that they have to juggle, and therefore relay on systems like task management systems or spreadsheets to organize their workflows. Recruitlang's purpose is to faciliate and ease that process, so that way vendor or resource managers can put their time and effort into recruiting the right talent instead of the majority of their time on figuring out on how to manage the workflow.

### **Key Features**
